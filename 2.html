Technical Support when Building Your Own PC 
With a name-brand system you'll most likely have technical support available to you if you run in to any issues, but depending on where you purchase your computer, your experience with technical support may vary greatly. When you build your own computer, you're not going to have a toll-free number to call for all-in-one support, but if you're resourceful, you can find just about any solution to your problem by posing questions to various forums on the Internet. There are many knowledgeable engineers out there that will be are more than happy to answer your questions and help you through the process to build your own computer.

Warranty Concerns with a DIY PC 
A store-bought system will likely include a warranty of some sort. You will not get this all-encompassing warranty with a DIY PC system. However, if you choose good quality products from well-known resellers (such as Tiger Direct), you will receive the warranty coverage of each product's manufacturer.

DIY PC Costs 
Now for the big question, am I going to save money by building my own PC? Well, the answer is a resounding "possibly." PCs are cheap nowadays, but sometimes they're cheap for a reason. PC manufacturers may outfit your new system with standard parts that you, as a DIY PC builder, would choose not to use due to low quality construction or limited compatibility and/or upgradeability. You have a good chance of saving money when you build your own PC, but don't expect an incredible cost savings. What you can expect by building your own pc is to learn a great deal about the inner-workings of your computer. You will also end up with a system customized to your exact specifications--no more, no less. So, is it worth it? I definitely think so...

Operating System and Software 
If you've ever purchased a PC before (especially recently), you know that a store-bought, pre-assembled system will most likely be pre-loaded with an operating system and a suite of software. The operating system will likely be highly customized by the PC manufacturer and will be pre-loaded with a lot of software that you will NEVER need. You'll also find free trials of software that vendors have paid the PC manufacturer to load onto their systems in the hopes that you'll be enticed enough to buy the full versions. This practice often gets out of hand, and the customer ends up with a system so bogged down with "crapware" that it runs horribly slow right out of the box. Needless to say, when you build your own PC, you have total control over what is installed on your new DIY PC. This is one of the HUGE benefits you realize when you build your own PC.</h2>
