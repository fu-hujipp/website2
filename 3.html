Do it Yourself Computer Kits are available for almost any type of computer you're aspiring to build.
Most DIY PC kits are referred to as "barebonesicon" systems. A barebones kit is essentially a computer case, power supply, motherboard, and sometimes cpu. The kit may also (but not often) come with memory (RAM), a video card, and hard disk.

An operating system (such as Windows 7) will usually NOT be included with DIY PC or Barebones computer kits. However, the actual components will vary from kit-to-kit. 

Helpful Tip: If you are building a new computer or upgrading an older model, you can greatly improve performance by installing a solid state drive (SSD) instead of a conventional hard drive.


Buying and assembling a barebones kit (or DIY Computer Kit ) is a great way to get started if you've never built your own DIY computer before. A lot of the confusion that can result from buying incompatible parts is avoided, and as a result, your experience becomes a more rewarding and enjoyable one.

A DIY PC or Barebones Kit's price can vary greatly depending on the components included. Some are designed for a modest DIY PC that may only be used for simple internet browsing and email. Others are designed to give the builder a solid framework for building a very powerful and upgradeable gaming or high performance computing platform.

If you would rather buy your parts individually or can't find a barbones kit that suits your need, you can always buy parts for DIY computer kits individually. Again, take extreme care that the parts you choose are compatible with each other..</h2>
