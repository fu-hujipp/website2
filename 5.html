Now that you've selected your the components for your new PC, it's time to start preparing your work area. You should find an open area that's easily accessible--a clean DRY kitchen table usually works quite well. If you have an anti-static mat, use it! It will help to protect your components from damage due to accidental static discharge. It'll also help protect your kitchen table from some potentially nasty scratches.
